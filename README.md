This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project was designed and developed by astounding members of BitPunks team.
Bit Punks are young perspective assembly of developers and designers coming from BHFF. Perfectly balanced (as all things should be, lil Thanos reference here for MCU pals) mix of design, development and Genetic Engineering.
